"""A little program for evaluating a girl's responses using the NLTK SIA."""
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Written by Simon Slamka in pursuit of a successful online communication with a girl.
# I could never really talk to people and read them, recognize their intent and emotions.
# That's the reason I made this.
# Of course, all this is for entertainment purposes only.
# The model is not so precise and can't be trusted with life.

# Put in more messages to potentially increase precision.
